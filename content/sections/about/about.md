 I am a Full Stack Web Developer and graduate of the Flatiron School, Software Engineering bootcamp. I've always had a fascination with technology.

I work with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

I am eager to learn new skills, stay up to date with the latest technology, and strive for continuous improvement in this  industry.
